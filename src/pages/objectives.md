- Preventing violence against women and girls by empowering women and girls, especially those who are at risk of violence – including adolescent girls and indigenous or ethnic minority women – and engaging strategic groups such as youth, men and boys, and traditional and faith-based leaders in prevention efforts.
- Expanding access to services available to survivors, including legal assistance, psychosocial counselling, health care and other support services; and building the capacity of service providers to respond effectively to the needs of women and girls affected by violence
- Strengthening implementation of laws, policies and action plans on violence against women and girls through data collection and analysis; building capacities of professionals charged with implementation; and strengthening institutions to become more effective, transparent and accountable in addressing violence against women.
- Placing special emphasis on programmes addressing the intersections of violence against women and HIV/AIDS; as well as those working with particularly vulnerable populations - such as survivors of sexual violence in conflict, post-conflict and unstable situations.
- Intensifying efforts to turn policy pledges into reality for women and girls by expanding the quality and quantity of support available for effective prevention and support programmes on the grass-roots level.
- Paving the way for knowledge-based action on ending violence against women and girls - generating and disseminating knowledge on ‘what works’ in the field of ending violence against women; and serving as a hub of knowledge on best practices for adaptation and expansion
- Strengthening the role and contributions of the Trust Fund system at the global, regional and country levels; building on the Trust’s commitment to ‘deliver as one’ advance implementation of national strategies to end violence against women and girls.
- Providing safe houses and/or Emergency Housing Vouchers (EHVs) intended to assist individuals and families who are homeless or facing housing instability, as well as individuals and families who are fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking or human trafficking.
- Working in memory of Agnes Tirop and celebrating her life.
- Fund-raising by organising events that can generate significant revenue: fun run/walk events, including marathons, half marathons, 5Ks or other popular distance running events; non-sporting competitions; auctions; art exhibitions; galas; concerts, etc.
